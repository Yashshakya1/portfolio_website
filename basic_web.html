    <p>

        C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

        C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

        C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

        The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23.
        
        Features of C++
    The main features C++ programming language are as follows:

    Simple: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, and has a rich library support and a variety of datatypes.
    Machine Independent: C++ code can be run on any machine as long as a suitable compiler is provided.
    Low-level Access: C++ provides low-level access to system resources, which makes it a suitable choice for system programming and writing efficient code.
    Fast Execution Speed: C++ is one of the fastest high-level languages. There is no additional processing overhead in C++, it is blazing fast.
    Object-Oriented: One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. large-scale applications can be built.
