    <h1><strong>html(Hypertext Markup Language)</strong></h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the structure of a webpage by using a series of elements, tags, and attributes to organize text, images, links, and other multimedia elements.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.</li>
      <li>It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
      <li>It is a static language, meaning that it does not inherently provide interactive features but can be combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>current version of html</h2>
    <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the 
        tag which defines the structure of web pages.HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved the markup available for documents and has introduced application programming interfaces(API) and Document Object Model(DOM). It has introduced various new features like drag and drop, geo-location services, multimedia features, easy doctype declaration, offline data storage, graphic elements, and various 
        semantic tags like the article, section, header, footer, figure, summary, etc. It is supported by all modern browsers.

    <h3><u>why html 5</u></h3>
    <p>
        Below are some differences that may or may not have caught your attention since developers started using HTML5:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Some data can be stored on the user's device, which means apps are cached and can continue to work properly without an Internet connection.</li>
        <li>Web pages can display fonts with a wider array of colors, shadows, and other beautiful effects.</li>
        <li>Objects on the page can be more responsive and can move in response to the user's cursor movements.</li>
        <li>New elements like section, header, article, and nav can replace most div elements, which helps eliminate div soups and makes it easier to scan for mistakes.</li>
    </ol>
